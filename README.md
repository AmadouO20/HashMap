# **HashMap Implementation - Chaining**

Using a dynamic array to store a hash table and implement chaining for collision
resolution using a singly linked list. In an optimized hash map,
the average case performance of all operations must be kept to O(1) time
complexity. Chains of key/value pairs must be stored in linked list nodes.

The number of objects stored in the hash map will be between 0 and 1,000,000
inclusive.

Two pre-written classes are provided in a6_include.py - DynamicArray
and LinkedList.
