# **HashMap Implementation - Chaining**

Using a dynamic array to store a hash table and implement chaining for collision
resolution using a singly linked list. In an optimized hash map,
the average case performance of all operations must be kept to O(1) time
complexity. Chains of key/value pairs must be stored in linked list nodes.

The number of objects stored in the hash map will be between 0 and 1,000,000
inclusive.

Two pre-written classes are provided in a6_include.py - DynamicArray
and LinkedList.

# **HashMap Implementation - Open Addressing**

Using a dynamic array to store a hash table, and implement Open Addressing
with Quadratic Probing for collision resolution inside that dynamic array. Key/value
pairs must be stored in the array. In an optimized hash map, the average case
performance of all operations must be kept to O(1) time complexity.

The number of objects stored in the hash map will be between 0 and 1,000,000
inclusive.

Using the pre-written DynamicArray class in a6_include.py. Using a DynamicArray object to store
your Open Addressing hash table.
